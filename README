New version of BBox LabelTool for dataset image annotation with mongodb connectivity.

Specify the parameters in run.py to use.
Directory structure should look like this:

Top directory:
---- subdir 1 (ex: Ford)
    ---- images for the brand of the subdirectory they are in
---- subdir 2 (ex: Chevy)
---- subdir n

To create hotkeys for all of your brands, use key_bindings.json.
# Several keys have already been taken for dataset navigation:
    # 3 and 4 to cycle backward and forward thru your images respectively
    # 2 to save annotations to the mongodb (cycling images without saving will clear annotations,
        as will using the delete button)
    # Escape to cancel the creation of bbox
    # space to send an image to the "skip" subdir under the given top directory
